Proposal Guide







Do not get a head of your self

 	we have set windows for each exams





TASK 1



MONDAY TO THURSDAY



we can do the design first



The proposal must be done first which is us looking at it and what problem there is



Look at MARK SCHEME IN THE EXAM



Read the booklet fully



make sure you can brake it down



make a statement of scope  how big it is but what Im going to focus on



LOOK AT OUR WORK AND ASK FULLY IDENTIFI THE PROBLEMS



COMPREHESIVE LINES OF REASIONING



Most have a good solution which meets the needs of the users, clients



SO WHAT ask me self at the end of an statement



Wider narrow for the legal stuff



6marks for have 4 good lists



Fun(feature)- resistor user

non fun(how to make ^ it work)- back end database, secretly, encrypted passwords, audit, form, unique username check



Fun(feature)- login

non fun(how to make ^ it work)-



Fun(feature)-

non fun(how to make ^ it work)-

non fun(how to make ^ it work)-





**A fully normalized database to 3 normal form**

no repeating data redundant data





TASK 1 DESIGN



interface design



Fun-

non fun-



justify why even if im repeating me self



colour scheme



images with alt text to tell what it is if not loaded



It is not final



do not give psodo code that going to appear and tell why we are doing it



stick we a design



comment to make it sound that it not made in development



why is it in a common



Reusable, sustainable make it bold like it punching the marker





audit table is for security so we know how was on line and what they did and we can IP search



$conn is a database connection

$post is to post something to the database



good, long, descriptive variable name



try catch will catch error message and throw it to the user



6 for what we plan to test and what data(It can be change since stuff can change)



why should test arsonist date, extreme data





register, login, make an apt, change apt, see





**good use of technical language**







TASK 2 Solutions



Friday



submit the last task on teams





first thing I must do is to open a test table and every time I look at my code write it down on the test table





FUNCTIONALITY/CODE ORGANISTION/LEGAL \& REGULATORY GUIDELINES \& STANDARDS/TESTING



We use 4 languages



testing table will drive it(We are showing the proses)



code it easily maintainable by a third party--file name make sense and logical organisation, and is commented





accessibility



compatibility



legal and ethical considerations



security controls to ensure confidentiality integrity



Using normal data, erroneous data, extreme



comment shows a comprehensive understanding of how error/problem were identified and how they were rectified



have an minimal of 3 versions



KPI



are as a business what they will expected in the 



increase in rating on trust pilot

increase sales

increase in booking

increase in better reviews



User acceptance requirement



Do not have to be lift out of user story but it can be helpful and then put them in a organised list





SCOPE



the size of the project could be large. Make reference that the project could be and explain why your do this



"I understand that we are sailing a products but we are going to focus on the booking/appointment"



Mention the time scale and it outside of the technical remit(role, task, realm)



DONT RUSH ANTHING







Task 2 - Developing the solution





SULIABILTY OF TEST DATA



3 separet testing table for each version(V1-testing table, V2)









EVALUATING FEEBACK



A comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the content of the appropriateness of the assets selected, validity and reliability of the source used, legal and ethical implication of using the identified assets



Talk about copyright and the proper way of getting permission



Go through different sources











EVALUATION OF PROJECT OUTCOMES



We go through every funk require \& non-funk require , KPIs, user acceptance criteria and rate if you have meet with them 



Why want a convincing and perceptive rationale for future is provided they should be meaningful impacted



SO BE BRUTAL ONSITE ABOUT OUR SELF, THE GOOD THE BAD AND WHAT WENT WRONG





FIRST THING IS A TABLE SPILT INTO 4 AND IS A DIDN'T MEET, MEET, IMPROVED
