                         hackers who try stolen passwords on multiple sitesâ€”a tactic called credential stuffing. 
                         If you reuse the same password and one account is breached, all your other accounts become vulnerable too. 
                         Unique passwords limit the damage of a breach, help prevent identity theft, and keep your sensitive information safe. 
                         Using a password manager makes it easy to generate and store strong, unique passwords without needing to remember them all.

                 Over time, passwords can become compromised through data breaches, phishing attacks, or simply by being reused across multiple accounts. 
                 By updating your password frequently and using strong, unique combinations, you reduce the risk of identity theft and keep your online accounts more secure.
